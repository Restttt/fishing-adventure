    <p>Meet your friendly captain and then set for the waters offshore, which are rich in a variety of game species such
      as sailfish, swordfish, marlin, mahi mahi, wahoo, and tuna, to name a few. You'll spend approximately 3.5 hours at
      sea angling for an amazing catch or simply relaxing on deck and absorbing the magical atmosphere of the sea. If
      you're not quite ready to go back to the ship after your fishing journy, enjoy extra time to shop, relax on the
      beach or take part in any of Grand Bahama Island's countless activities. Just check the Shore Excursions Desk
      aboard the ship for a variety of suggestions that will perfectly enhance your day in paradise. </p>
